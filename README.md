# The Visualizer

> **Purpose:** Showcase creative visualization skills across Power BI, Tableau, Excel, SQL, and Python. The Visualizer is both a **core system repository of datasets** and a **demonstration stage** for data storytelling. It exists to train, display, and refine my process for turning raw data into clear, engaging dashboards.

---

## Role in the Constellation

* **Core System (datasets repository):** Catalogs datasets curated for *visual richness* rather than scale or governance.
* **Creative Lab:** Proves I can take any dataset ‚Äî structured, messy, or quirky ‚Äî and design visuals that highlight story, insight, and craft.
* **Bridge:** Connects portfolio-wide engineering credibility (from the **Barycenter**) to polished storytelling artifacts.

---

## Datasets (Creative Focus)

The Visualizer draws from a set of public and open datasets designed to spark visual practice:

* üé∂ **Spotify Charts** ‚Äî animated genre evolution, race charts
* üé¨ **IMDB / TMDB** ‚Äî network of actors, movie revenue bubbles
* üèò **Airbnb (Inside Airbnb)** ‚Äî geospatial density, pricing insights
* üç∑ **Wine Reviews** ‚Äî flavor wheels, ratings vs ABV scatterplots
* üåå **NASA Exoplanet Archive** ‚Äî scatterplots of exoplanet size vs orbit
* üé® **Museum APIs (MET, Rijksmuseum)** ‚Äî timelines of artworks, thematic networks

## Launch Quests

Initial projects to demonstrate range and creativity:

1. **Spotify Genre Race Chart** (Tableau) ‚Äî visualizing global top genres over time.
2. **IMDB Actor Network** (Python/Plotly) ‚Äî graph of frequent co-stars.
3. **Airbnb Density Map** (Power BI) ‚Äî slicers for price, host, and neighborhood.
4. **Wine Flavor Wheel** (Excel) ‚Äî polished radial chart for tasting descriptors.
5. **Exoplanet Discovery Timeline** (Tableau) ‚Äî scatter with timeline slider.

## Next Steps

* [ ] Build first Tableau viz (Spotify genre race).
* [ ] Upload first Power BI dashboard (Airbnb density map).
* [ ] Add YAML descriptors for initial datasets in `creative/`.
* [ ] Capture demo screenshots and embed here.
